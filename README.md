## Overview

A modular Python-based framework for 802.11 reconnaissance, wardriving, and penetration testing.

This tool is intended to be used as a fast pipeline that collects WPS material without committing to cracking (potentially useful in statistical modeling on WPS configuration prevalence).

Current tools like `reaver` or `bully` are designed to sit and wait. Instead of "Target -> Retrieve Message -> Crack -> Next", this tool aims to automate the process without stopping on one target "Scan -> Retrieve Message -> Store -> Next"

## Project Roadmap / To-Do List

[ ] Monitor Mode Toggle: Create a reliable method to take an interface down, set mode to monitor, and bring it up.

[ ] Structured Scanning: enhance core/scan.py to parse active clients (Stations) associated with a chosen AP, not just the APs themselves.

[ ] GPS Integration: Implement a thread to read data from a USB GPS dongle to tag discovered BSSIDs with coordinates.

[ ] Kismet/Wigle Compatibility: Export scan results to formats compatible with Wigle.net uploading.

[ ] WPS Harvest Mode: Automate WPS transaction initialization with neighbouring APs to capture M1 - M3 messages, and store the cryptographic parameters (PKE, PKR, E-Hash1, E-Hash2, AuthKey) for offline pin cracking.

[ ] Priority Harvest: Implement a priority queue that sorts discovered APs by a score based on: OUI (Known Vulnerable Manufacturers), Signal Strength (RSSI), WPS State (Unlocked), regex (router ESSIDs that I've observed are almost always vulnerable). High-score targets are processed first.
